/**
 * \namespace Gyoto::Astrobj
 * \brief Access to astronomical objects 
 *
 *  Objects which are supposed to be the target of the ray-tracing
 *  code should inherit from the Gyoto::Astrobj::Generic class.
 *
 *  When implementing a new object, you must:
 *    - make sure the object can be loaded from XML by providing a
 *      Subcontractor_t using the Gyoto::Astrobj::Register(std::string
 *      name, Gyoto::Astrobj::Subcontractor_t* scp) function;
 *    - make sure this subcontractor is registerred in the initialization
 *      routine of your plug-in;
 *    - make sure  Generic::Impact() works (see below).
 *
 *  In addition, you should make sure that your object plays nicely in
 *  the Yorick plug-in, which means:
 *    - implement the copy constructor and the Generic::clone() method;
 *    - implement the fillElement method, used for printing and saving to
 *      XML.
 *
 *  There are basically two ways of making Generic::Impact() work: either by
 *  providing your own Generic::Impact() function, or by implementing a bunch
 *  of lower level, simpler functions which are used by the generic
 *  Generic::Impact(). Those lower functions are not pure virtual, but
 *  the default throws a runtime error:
 *    - Generic::operator()() yields a distance or potential defining the interior
 *      of the object;
 *    - Generic::getVelocity() yields the velocity field of the fluid ;
 *    - Generic::processHitQuantities() fills the Spectrum etc. quantities in the
 *      data parameter of Generic::Impact().
 *
 *  Generic::processHitQuantities() itself is like Generic::Impact() in that you have
 *  two choices: either reimplement it or implement a second lot of
 *  small, low-level functions:
 *    - Generic::emission();
 *    - Generic::integrateEmission();
 *    - Generic::transmission().
 *
 * To be usable, a Astrobj::Generic sub-classes should register an
 * Astrobj::Subcontractor_t function using the Astrobj::Register()
 * function. See also \ref writing_plugins_page .
